# TinyTask MCP

## NOTE:
This is the simplest task management system I could create. I need this for experimentation in a another research project exploring agentic team workflows, collaboration, etc. Probably the biggest gaps are that there is no auth or the concept of users. Tasks are assigned to arbitrary names and the name becomes the queue of work for the name. This project was written entirely using AI (specifically RooCode and Anthropic). From start to finish the initial project took just a few hours and cost about $15.50 in tokens.

## Description

A minimal task management system designed for LLM agent collaboration, exposed as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Complete CRUD operations for tasks with status tracking (idle, working, complete)
- **Comment System**: Add, update, and delete comments on tasks
- **Link/Artifact Tracking**: Associate URLs and artifacts with tasks
- **Agent Queue Management**: Per-agent task queues with priority sorting
- **Task Assignment & Routing**: Assign and reassign tasks between agents
- **Persistent Storage**: SQLite database with full data persistence
- **Flexible Transport**: Supports stdio (local), Streamable HTTP (default remote), and legacy SSE transports
- **Docker Ready**: Containerized deployment with docker-compose

## Quick Start

### Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run TinyTask MCP is using Docker:

> **Note**: Docker Compose v2+ is required. The `version` field has been removed from `docker-compose.yml` for v2+ compatibility. If you're using Docker Compose v1.x, please upgrade to v2.0 or later.

```bash
# Start the server
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the server
docker-compose down
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run Streamable HTTP (default HTTP transport)
npm run start:http

# Run Streamable HTTP with stdio sidecar
npm run start:both

# Legacy SSE (HTTP) transport
npm run start:http:sse

# Legacy SSE with stdio sidecar
npm run start:both:sse

# Direct stdio mode (no HTTP server)
npm run start:stdio

# Development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev
```

> **Need guidance on which option to pick?** See the [HTTP Transport Selection](#http-transport-selection) section and the dedicated [docs/product/streamable-http-migration-guide.md](docs/product/streamable-http-migration-guide.md).

## MCP Client Configuration

### Stdio Mode (Local)

For local development with MCP clients like Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tinytask": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/tinytask-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TINYTASK_MODE": "stdio",
        "TINYTASK_DB_PATH": "/path/to/data/tinytask.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP Mode (Streamable HTTP - Default)

For HTTP-based access using the Streamable HTTP transport (recommended):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tinytask": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### SSE Mode (Legacy)

If you explicitly enable SSE via `TINYTASK_ENABLE_SSE=true`, the endpoint is the same, but you may want a different client profile to track the legacy transport:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tinytask-sse": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-Tinytask-Transport": "sse"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
> SSE continues to work for backward compatibility but will be removed in a future major release. Plan migrations with the [docs/product/streamable-http-migration-guide.md](docs/product/streamable-http-migration-guide.md).

## Environment Variables

- `TINYTASK_MODE`: Server mode (`stdio`, `http`, or `both`) - default: `both`
- `TINYTASK_ENABLE_SSE`: Force legacy SSE transport when `true` (default: `false`)
- `TINYTASK_PORT`: HTTP server port - default: `3000`
- `TINYTASK_HOST`: HTTP server host - default: `0.0.0.0`
- `TINYTASK_DB_PATH`: Path to SQLite database file - default: `./data/tinytask.db`
- `TINYTASK_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level - default: `info`

## Logging Configuration

TinyTask MCP supports multiple logging levels for debugging and troubleshooting agent interactions.

### Log Levels

- **`error`**: Only errors (minimal production logging)
- **`warn`**: Warnings and errors
- **`info`**: Important operations (default, backward compatible)
- **`debug`**: Detailed debugging including tool calls and validation
- **`trace`**: Full forensic logging with complete request/response bodies

### Setting Log Level

#### Docker (Recommended)

Edit `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  TINYTASK_LOG_LEVEL: trace  # Change from 'info' to enable forensic logging
```

Then restart:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f tinytask  # Watch logs in real-time
```

#### Local Development

```bash
# Set for single run
TINYTASK_LOG_LEVEL=debug npm run dev

# Or export for session
export TINYTASK_LOG_LEVEL=trace
npm run dev
```

#### MCP Client (stdio mode)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tinytask": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/tinytask-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TINYTASK_MODE": "stdio",
        "TINYTASK_LOG_LEVEL": "debug"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Agent Issues

If an agent (like goose) is having issues creating tasks or performing operations:

1. **Enable forensic logging** by setting `TINYTASK_LOG_LEVEL=trace`
2. **Reproduce the issue** with the agent
3. **Review the logs** for:
   - Full request body showing what the agent sent
   - Validation errors indicating missing or invalid fields
   - Full response body showing what was returned
   - Tool execution errors with stack traces

4. **Common issues revealed by trace logging**:
   - Missing required fields in requests
   - Wrong data types (e.g., string instead of number)
   - Invalid enum values for status
   - Session management problems in SSE mode
   - Encoding issues in request bodies

5. **Return to normal logging** after troubleshooting by setting `TINYTASK_LOG_LEVEL=info`

### Performance Impact

- **error/warn/info**: Negligible overhead (< 1ms per request)
- **debug**: Minimal overhead (~1-2ms per request)
- **trace**: Small overhead (~3-5ms per request) - use only for troubleshooting

## API Overview

### Tools

TinyTask MCP exposes the following tools for LLM agents:

#### Task Tools
- `create_task` - Create a new task
- `update_task` - Update an existing task
- `get_task` - Retrieve a task by ID
- `delete_task` - Delete a task
- `archive_task` - Archive a completed task
- `list_tasks` - List all tasks
- `get_my_queue` - Get tasks assigned to a specific agent
- **`signup_for_task`** ⚡ - Claim highest priority idle task and mark as working (atomic)
- **`move_task`** ⚡ - Transfer task to another agent with handoff comment (atomic)

**⚡ High-Efficiency Tools**: These tools combine multiple operations into single atomic transactions, reducing token consumption by 40-60% for common workflows.

#### Comment Tools
- `add_comment` - Add a comment to a task
- `update_comment` - Update a comment
- `delete_comment` - Delete a comment
- `list_comments` - List all comments for a task

#### Link Tools
- `add_link` - Add a link/artifact to a task
- `update_link` - Update a link
- `delete_link` - Delete a link
- `list_links` - List all links for a task

### Resources

TinyTask MCP provides the following resources:

- `task://{id}` - Full task details with comments and links
- `queue://{agent_name}` - Agent's task queue
- `tasks://active` - All active (non-archived) tasks
- `tasks://idle` - All idle tasks
- `tasks://working` - All tasks in progress
- `tasks://complete` - All completed tasks
- `tasks://by-priority` - Tasks sorted by priority
- `tasks://unassigned` - Tasks not assigned to any agent

For detailed API documentation, see [API Documentation](docs/technical/mcp-api-design.md)

## HTTP Transport Selection

TinyTask now uses Streamable HTTP as the default HTTP transport. The legacy SSE transport can still be enabled via configuration for environments that rely on it.

| Scenario | `TINYTASK_MODE` | `TINYTASK_ENABLE_SSE` | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default HTTP deployment | `http` | _unset_ / `false` | Streamable HTTP (unified `/mcp` endpoint)
| Mixed stdio + HTTP | `both` | _unset_ / `false` | stdio + Streamable HTTP
| Legacy SSE (HTTP only) | `http` | `true` | SSE (deprecated)
| Legacy SSE + stdio | `both` | `true` | stdio + SSE

When `TINYTASK_MODE=stdio`, no HTTP transport is started regardless of `TINYTASK_ENABLE_SSE`.

The routing logic lives in [src/server/http.ts](src/server/http.ts:1). It delegates to the Streamable HTTP implementation in [src/server/streamable-http.ts](src/server/streamable-http.ts:1) by default and falls back to the SSE implementation in [src/server/sse.ts](src/server/sse.ts:1) when the legacy flag is enabled.

Refer to the [docs/product/streamable-http-migration-guide.md](docs/product/streamable-http-migration-guide.md) for detailed migration steps and troubleshooting tips.

## Architecture

TinyTask MCP follows a layered architecture:

1. **Transport Layer**: Handles stdio, Streamable HTTP, and SSE communication
2. **MCP Server Layer**: Implements MCP protocol (tools & resources)
3. **Service Layer**: Business logic for tasks, comments, and links
4. **Database Layer**: SQLite with Better-SQLite3

For detailed architecture documentation, see [Architecture Documentation](docs/technical/architecture.md)

## Example Workflows

### Feature Development Workflow (Using High-Efficiency Tools)

1. **Product Agent** creates a feature request:
```typescript
create_task({
  title: "Add dark mode toggle",
  description: "Users want dark mode option",
  assigned_to: "architect-agent",
  created_by: "product-agent",
  priority: 10
})
```

2. **Architect Agent** claims and works on task:
```typescript
// 🚀 NEW: Claim task in one operation (was 3 tool calls)
const task = signup_for_task({ agent_name: "architect-agent" })
// Task is now marked as 'working' and includes all comments/links

// Add design document
add_link({
  task_id: task.id,
  url: "/docs/dark-mode-design.md",
  description: "Architecture design"
})

// 🚀 NEW: Transfer to developer with handoff comment (was 3 tool calls)
move_task({
  task_id: task.id,
  current_agent: "architect-agent",
  new_agent: "code-agent",
  comment: "Architecture complete. Design doc attached. Ready for implementation."
})
```

3. **Code Agent** claims and implements:
```typescript
// 🚀 NEW: Claim transferred task in one operation
const task = signup_for_task({ agent_name: "code-agent" })
// Automatically gets highest priority idle task with handoff comment

// Implement and complete
add_comment({ task_id: task.id, content: "Implementation complete" })
update_task({ id: task.id, status: "complete" })
```

4. **Integration Agent** archives:
```typescript
archive_task({ id: task.id })
```

**Token Savings**: This workflow uses 2 fewer tool calls per agent handoff, saving ~40-60% tokens on task management operations.

### Traditional Workflow (Still Supported)

For specialized scenarios, all individual tools remain available:

```typescript
// Check queue manually
const queue = get_my_queue({ agent_name: "architect-agent" })
const task = queue.tasks[0]

// Update status manually
update_task({ id: task.id, status: "working" })

// Transfer manually
update_task({ id: task.id, assigned_to: "code-agent", status: "idle" })
add_comment({ task_id: task.id, content: "Handoff message" })
```
